Important Note:
If you encounter issues logging in with an account that has Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled, please note that this script currently does not support accounts with 2FA enabled. Due to security measures implemented by Discord, authentication with accounts having 2FA enabled requires additional steps that are not handled by this script.

To use this script successfully:

Ensure 2FA is disabled: Please disable Two-Factor Authentication for the Discord account you intend to use with this script. You can re-enable it after logging in if needed.

Alternative Account: If you prefer to keep 2FA enabled for security reasons, consider using a separate Discord account without 2FA enabled specifically for this script.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.
